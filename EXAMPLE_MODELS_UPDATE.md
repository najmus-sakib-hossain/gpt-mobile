## Overview

Updated the example models list on the home screen to use SmolChat-Android's recommended models with proper download functionality.

---

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Example Models List

**Source:** Based on SmolChat-Android's `ExampleModelsList.kt`

**New Models (4 models):**

1. **SmolLM2-360M-Instruct** (~380 MB)
   - Tiny 360M parameter model
   - Perfect for mobile devices with limited resources
   - Model ID: `HuggingFaceTB/SmolLM2-360M-Instruct-GGUF`

2. **SmolLM2-1.7B-Instruct** (~1.1 GB)
   - Small but powerful 1.7B model
   - Optimized for mobile with Q4_K_M quantization
   - Model ID: `HuggingFaceTB/SmolLM2-1.7B-Instruct-GGUF`

3. **Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct** (~1.6 GB)
   - Excellent instruction following capabilities
   - Q8_0 quantization for better quality
   - Model ID: `Qwen/Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct-GGUF`

4. **Qwen2.5-Coder-3B-Instruct** (~2.3 GB)
   - Specialized for coding tasks
   - 3B parameters with Q5_0 quantization
   - Model ID: `Qwen/Qwen2.5-Coder-3B-Instruct-GGUF`

### 2. Enhanced ExampleModel Data Class

**Before:**

```kotlin
data class ExampleModel(
    val name: String,
    val url: String,
    val description: String
)
```

**After:**

```kotlin
data class ExampleModel(
    val name: String,
    val modelId: String,      // HuggingFace model ID
    val fileName: String,      // Specific GGUF file name
    val url: String,           // Direct download URL
    val description: String,
    val size: String          // Human-readable size
)
```

### 3. Proper Download Navigation

**Before:**

- "Get" button navigated to browser screen
- No direct access to model details
- User had to search for the model again

**After:**

- "Download" button navigates directly to model detail page
- Shows the specific model with all its files
- User can immediately download the recommended file
- URL-encoded model ID for safe navigation

**Implementation:**

```kotlin
onModelDetailsClick = { modelId ->
    val encodedModelId = java.net.URLEncoder.encode(modelId, "UTF-8")
    navController.navigate("offlineModelDetail/$encodedModelId")
}
```

### 4. Improved UI/UX

**Example Model Cards Now Show:**

- âœ… Model name (clean, no quantization in name)
- âœ… Description
- âœ… Size estimate (e.g., "~380 MB", "~1.1 GB")
- âœ… "Download" button (instead of "Get")
- âœ… Download icon with text

**Visual Changes:**

```
Before:
SmolLM2-135M-Instruct (Q4_K_M)
Compact 135M parameter model...
[Get]

After:
SmolLM2-360M-Instruct
Tiny 360M model, perfect for mobile devices
Size: ~380 MB
[ðŸ“¥ Download]
```

## Why These Models?

### Size Optimization

- **SmolLM2-360M**: Ultra-light, runs on any device
- **SmolLM2-1.7B**: Best balance of size and capability
- **Qwen2.5-1.5B**: Similar size to SmolLM2-1.7B, different architecture
- **Qwen2.5-Coder**: Specialized for code, worth the extra size

### Quantization Choices

- **Q8_0**: High quality, slightly larger (SmolLM2-360M, Qwen2.5-1.5B)
- **Q4_K_M**: Good balance (SmolLM2-1.7B)
- **Q5_0**: Better quality for coding tasks (Qwen2.5-Coder)

### Source Repositories

- **HuggingFaceTB**: Official HuggingFace models
- **Qwen**: Official Alibaba Cloud Qwen models
- All from trusted, official sources (not third-party conversions)

## User Flow

### Old Flow (Broken)

1. User clicks "Get" on example model
2. Navigate to model browser
3. Browser is empty or shows wrong models
4. User confused, doesn't know what to search

### New Flow (Working)

1. User clicks "Download" on example model
2. Navigate directly to that model's detail page
3. See model info, stats, and all available files
4. Click on the recommended GGUF file
5. Download starts immediately
6. Model appears in home screen when done

## Technical Details

### Files Modified

1. **`HuggingFaceModels.kt`**
   - Enhanced `ExampleModel` data class
   - Updated `exampleModelsList` with SmolChat models
   - Added size information

2. **`HomeScreen.kt`**
   - Added `onModelDetailsClick` callback
   - URL encoding for safe navigation
   - Updated button text to "Download"
   - Added size display in cards

### Navigation Safety

Model IDs with slashes (e.g., `HuggingFaceTB/SmolLM2-360M-Instruct-GGUF`) are URL-encoded:

```kotlin
val encodedModelId = java.net.URLEncoder.encode(modelId, "UTF-8")
// HuggingFaceTB/SmolLM2-360M-Instruct-GGUF 
// becomes: HuggingFaceTB%2FSmolLM2-360M-Instruct-GGUF
```

This prevents navigation crashes and ensures proper routing.
